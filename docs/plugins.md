# Plugins

[WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org) comes straight out of the box with WordPlate. It mirrors the WordPress [plugin](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org) and [theme](https://themes.svn.wordpress.org) directories as a Composer repository.

Require the desired plugin or theme using `wpackagist-plugin` or `wpackagist-theme` as the vendor name. Packages are installed to `public/plugins`, `public/mu-plugins` or `public/themes`.

```bash
$ composer require wpackagist-plugin/hide-updates
```

This is an example of how your `composer.json` file might look like:

```json
"require": {
    "wordplate/framework": "^7.1",
    "wpackagist-plugin/hide-updates": "^1.0"
},
```

Please visit [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org) website for more information and examples.

## Must-use Plugins

With WordPlate you can enable standard plugins to be required just like [must-use](https://wordpress.org/support/article/must-use-plugins/) plugins.

> [Must-use plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/must-use-plugins/) (a.k.a. mu-plugins) are plugins installed in a special directory inside the content folder and which are automatically enabled on all sites in the installation.

Add the desired `mu-plugins` using `wpackagist-plugin` as the vendor name to `installer-paths` in your `composer.json` file.

```json
"extra": {
    "installer-paths": {
        "public/mu-plugins/{$name}": [
            "type:wordpress-muplugin",
            "wpackagist-plugin/hide-updates",
        ]
    }
}
```

Require the desired plugin using `wpackagist-plugin` as the vendor name.

```sh
$ composer require wpackagist-plugin/hide-updates
```

The plugin is installed to the `public/mu-plugins` directory.
